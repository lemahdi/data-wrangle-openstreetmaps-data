I chose Singapore because I recently moved to this city, and I think it's an original way to discover ot.

Singapore is a City-State located in South-East Asia. It is surrounded by Malaysia and Indonesia. Many communities live here and there are 4 official languages. The city combines modern and authentic architectures. Commuting is very easy as roads follow a good planification and the offer of public transport is diversified.
