I chose Singapore because I recently moved to this city, and I think it's an original way to discover it.

Singapore is a City-State located in South-East Asia. It is surrounded by Malaysia and Indonesia. Many communities live here and there are 4 official languages. The city combines modern and authentic architectures. Commuting is very easy as roads follow a good planification and the offer of public transport is diversified. We can find public WCs almost everywhere in Singapore especially in malls, hence restaurants do not provide this service.

The purpose of my analyses will be to help people find the nearest public toilet as this could be a serious issue especially for elder men.
